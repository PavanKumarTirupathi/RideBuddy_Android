## Overall Learning 

I completed a 6-month UI/UX Design training program at SureTrust, under the guidance of Ghirri Sudhan. During this training period, I developed a strong foundation in UI/UX design principles, including user research, information architecture, wireframing, and high-fidelity UI design. I gained hands-on experience working with design tools like Figma and applied mobile-first design approaches to real-world projects. The training also helped me improve my understanding of usability, visual hierarchy, consistency, and user-centered problem solving through practical design exercises and projects.

<p><strong><a href="#project1">Project 1:</a> Ride Buddy </p>



</div>

<!-- Project 1 -->
<h3 id="project1">Project 1: Ride Buddy </h3>
<p>
  RideBuddy was designed to address common problems in everyday commuting, such as difficulty finding nearby rides, lack of clarity in ride details, and complex booking flows in existing ride-sharing applications. The goal of the project was to create a seamless and intuitive experience that allows users to discover, evaluate, and book rides with minimal effort.

The design process involved understanding user pain points related to trust, speed, and usability in ride-sharing platforms. Based on these insights, the solution focuses on simplified user flows, clear ride information, and a clean interface that guides users naturally through the journey from ride discovery to confirmation. A mobile-first approach was adopted to ensure accessibility and ease of use for daily commuters.

RideBuddy highlights skills in problem definition, user-centered design, information hierarchy, and high-fidelity UI design, making it a strong portfolio project that demonstrates practical UX decision-making and modern design execution.
